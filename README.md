## Features

- **User Authentication**: Log in with a predefined username and password (no database required for authentication).
- **Media Upload**: Upload images (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`) and videos (`.mp4`) to the server.
- **Media Display**: View uploaded media files in a responsive, Material Design grid layout.
- **Media Deletion**: Delete uploaded media files directly from the interface.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
- **Socket.IO Integration**: Real-time updates for media upload and deletion events.

*Note:* 
* This tool is created by me as a base, and please consider all the neeed security fearures if you are planning to Implement in a production environment.
* The Docker imge that is found below is completely built based on the current base and doesnt have the security feature that is mentioned in the documentation, so if you are planning to implement this directly I'm not responsible for any kind of data breach within.
* *There is no telemetry in this code, Means I'm not collecting any type of data analytics form this project*

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

#### 1. A Linux, Windows or Mac Machine

#### 2. Containerization Application
You need one of the following containerization applications installed:

- **Docker CLI** (preferred)
- **Podman**
- **Rancher**

#### Installing Docker:

- [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

#### Installing Podman:
If you're using Podman, you can follow the official installation guide:
- [Podman Installation Guide](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation)

## How to Run the Project

### Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure that the following prerequisites are fulfilled:
1. A **Linux, Windows or Mac machine** with a containerization application like Docker, Podman, or Rancher.
2. Docker is recommended for this setup.

If Docker is not installed, please follow the instructions in the **Prerequisites** section to install Docker or another containerization application.

### Steps to Run the Application

1. **Open the terminal** on your Linux machine.

2. **Run the following Docker command** to start the container with the application:

    ```bash
    docker run -d --network="bridge" -p 5000:5000 sanjaykshebbar/dashboard_v2:v2
    ```

    #### Explanation of the Docker command:

    - `docker run`: This command runs a container from a specified image.
    - `-d`: This flag runs the container in the background (detached mode).
    - `--network="bridge"`: This specifies the network mode for the container. The `bridge` network is a default network in Docker, ensuring that the container can communicate with other containers on the same network.
    - `-p 5000:5000`: This flag maps the host machine's port 5000 to the container's port 5000, making the application accessible on port 5000 of your host machine.
    - `sanjaykshebbar/dashboard_v2:v2`: This is the name of the Docker image being used. It's a versioned image (`v2`), and this image contains the application code.

3. **Access the application**:
    - Once the container is running, you can access the application via a web browser.
    - Open a browser and enter the following URL to access the app:
    
    ```plaintext
    http://<IP/Hostname>:5000
    ```
    
    This will launch the blank page of the application.

4. **Access the Management Dashboard**:
    - To access the media management dashboard, navigate to the login page:
    
    ```plaintext
    http://<IP/Hostname>:5000/login
    ```
    
    - Enter the following credentials to log in: (This is the defaut user, where this can be removed / Modified later.)
      - **Username**: `Admin`
      - **Password**: `Password@123`

**Note:** Here the user name is case sensitive too.
    After logging in, you will have access to the **media management dashboard**. Here, you can manage the media content, which includes adding or removing media files (MP4 videos and JPG images).

---

### Managing Media:
Once logged in, you can:
- **Upload media**: Add new MP4 or JPG files to the media library.
- **Delete media**: Remove existing media files from the system.

### NOTE:
- This tool will automatically fetches the updated media content and get that displayed, where there is no manual intervention needed here.
- This tool doesnot need internet if hosting in an Isolated environment.
- In simple words this tool works as a wireless pendrive where the data (Images and Videos) will be shared over the local network to a remote display.
- This tool will save the data inside that container itself under the path /media, and based on the media management the data can be manuplated. (Removal and Addition)
